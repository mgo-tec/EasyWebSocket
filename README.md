# EasyWebSocket
Simple library for WebSocket communication with Arduino and smartphone browser.
This is still a beta version of the beta.

This library is a simple one that specializes in ON-OFF button and the slider(range) and Text display of the browser.

Using the latest smart phone, please use as much as possible high-speed CPU, large memory, high-speed network. Otherwise, there are times when traffic occurs to communicate cut off overflow.

It may interrupted communication in Safari, such as iPad. It might be stable and enough 100ms the s_rate from 50 case. However, follow-up will be bad.

It uses the SPIFFS file system.
Please upload the five text files in the EasyWebSocket_Test sample sketch of data folder in SPIFFS file system uploader.
